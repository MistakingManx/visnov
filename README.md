# What is this?
VisNov is a visual novel framework built in JavaScript for easy web support, currently undergoing development.
It'll be maintained and provide multiple methods for quality of life purposes, the focus will be usability and customization.
As I get suggestions and requests, I'll implement what I think would be benefitial.

I have a busy life though so progress may be slow. You're allowed to use this framework without crediting me, show me what you make with it!
